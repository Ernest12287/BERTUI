## 0.1.1 (2025-12-10) 🗺️ - Page Routing Implemented

This version delivers a major functional upgrade by integrating front-end routing, moving the library beyond static page serving.

### ✨ New Features

* **Integrated Page Routing:** The development server and build process now fully support client-side routing.
    * The template now uses **React Router DOM**  to manage navigation between pages.
    * Developers can now create multiple pages (`/src/pages/`) and define routes within the main application file.
* **Dynamic Asset Serving:** The dev server has been updated to correctly handle deep links and dynamic paths, ensuring the application loads correctly regardless of the URL.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements
 - added routing 

## 0.1.0 (2025-12-10) 🚀 - Initial Release (Static)

This is the very first release of BertUI (Bun Elisiya React Template User Interface), providing the core tooling for a lightning-fast, zero-configuration React experience.

### ✨ New Features

* **Zero-Configuration Tooling:** Automatically supports **JavaScript/JSX** and **TypeScript/TSX** files natively via Bun.
* **Integrated Development Server:** Starts with the command `bertui dev`, powered by **Elysia** for near-instant startup, featuring built-in **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** via WebSockets.
* **Optimized Production Build:** Creates a production-ready static build using the command `bertui build`, leveraging **Bun's native bundler** and **PostCSS** for CSS optimization (autoprefixer/minification).
* **Built-in Animation Utilities:** Includes high-quality, lightweight CSS utilities accessible via `import 'bertui/styles'`.
    * Classes include: `.fadein`, `.moveright`, `.bouncein`, `.split`, `.slideup`, and others.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

* **Static Pages Only:** This version was limited to serving a single static HTML file and did not support front-end routing (addressed in v0.1.1).

### 📦 Installation & Setup

* **`create-bertui`:** Use `bunx create-bertui <app-name>` to set up a new BertUI project template instantly.
